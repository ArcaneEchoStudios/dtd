Make Inventory Fun Again

On transition after a minigame, if the players equipment changed (or was added to), they must put them in their inventory

- Each character, by default, has a backpack. If no backpack is found on a character, assume they have a basic backpack. 
- Define some items as 'containers'. Certain containers can hold certain kinds of items
	- Scrollbook might hold magic scrolls but nothing else (bonus points if it can be done with clever size constraints: ex: scrolls are 1x5/6/7 and only scrollbooks can hold 5+ wide?)
	- Some items might be very difficult to manage. 
- Inventory management should know how to handle every item type (even if there is an "bucket of holding" for unknown types)
- Maybe an 'upgrade for'
