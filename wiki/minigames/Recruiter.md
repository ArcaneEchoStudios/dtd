Sometimes, people will come to your guild. They show up as an unread notifications and you can let them build up. When you decide to check in, you'll get a list of resumes you can either play, skip or decline. The resumes would be what class they are, and maybe an auto generated story or something.

If you choose to recruit them (play) then you launch a little dungeon builder. This could be (thematically) either a hiring test you have to build or a training montage. 

- You have X resources to build a little maze/puzzle/bad guy room for the recruit to play in
- Once you click go, the recruit sees how far they can get in your dungeon
- Each class of recruit introduces a new mechanic or piece you can add to your dungeon (bonus: teaching you the abilities of the class?)
- If the dungeon is too easy, you get him at low level (or maybe he thinks your guild is lame)
- If the test is super hard, you get him at a higher level (could he die before even joining?)

## Game Contract
The recruits are stored as additional inactive characters in the PC list. If dungeon pieces cost, it could interact with the gold stat.

## Transitions
[[Guild Hall]] to allow the use to immediate select the PCs in their party if they want
